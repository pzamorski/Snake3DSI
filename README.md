# Snake 3D

## Description

Snake is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake to collect food and avoid collisions with the walls of the board and its own tail. In this version of the game, the user starts with training artificial intelligence that controls the snake to learn game strategies. After completing the training stage, the user can proceed to the traditional game and control the snake independently.

## Features

- Random generation of food positions on the board
- Dynamic growth of snake length after eating food
- Display of player score and current game state
- Detection of collisions with the board walls and its own tail

## Instructions

1. Run the application to start training artificial intelligence.
2. During training, observe how artificial intelligence controls the snake, learning game strategies.
3. After completing the training, start the game in observation mode to observe the behavior of the snake in real-time.
